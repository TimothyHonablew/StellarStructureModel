This is my code for developing a one-dimensional stellar model for a ZAMS star of 4.20 solar masses and mass fractions of X = 0.69, Y = 0.24, and Z = 0.05.

The main.py script is where the program is executed from and where the model is supposed to reach convergence. Numerous errors occured which prevented this model from reaching convergence and complying with 
the results of MESA calculations done with an identical star. Please use this program at your own risk.
